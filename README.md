🕶️ ALL Obfuscator
Obfuscate like a ghost. Disappear li<Qke a pro.

⚙️ Description
ALL Obfuscator is a Python tool designed to make your source code unreadable and nearly s	indecipherable, with two levels of obfuscation:
    • basic → encoding + execution via exec(), clean but discreet.
    • extra → multiple recursive obfuscations (up to 5 layers), creating a "matryoshka" effect that’s impossible to read without breaking a sweat.

🧠 Why?
Because sometimes, you want to share or publish your script without everyone understanding what you did. Whether it’s for fun, CTFs, prototyping, or trolling... you’re the boss.
